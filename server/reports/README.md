# Reports Directory

This directory contains all reports generated from completed tasks in their original template formats (Word and Excel).

## Location
`D:\PJs\ChecksheetsApp\server\reports\`

## File Naming Convention
Reports are saved with the following format:
- `Task_{TASK_CODE}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.docx` (Word format)
- `Task_{TASK_CODE}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.xlsx` (Excel format)

Example: 
- `Task_PM-1234567890-ABCD1234_2024-01-15.docx`
- `Task_PM-1234567890-ABCD1234_2024-01-15.xlsx`

## Automatic Saving
All reports are automatically saved to this directory when:
1. A task is marked as completed
2. A user downloads a report (Word or Excel) from the web interface

## Template-Based Generation
- Reports are generated by filling original Word/Excel templates
- Formatting and layout come entirely from template files
- No hard-coded layouts - templates are the source of truth

## Access
- **Server-side**: All reports are permanently stored here
- **Browser**: Reports are also downloaded to your browser's default Downloads folder

## Notes
- Reports are never automatically deleted
- You can manually organize or archive reports as needed
- The directory is created automatically on first report generation
- Word templates use docxtemplater with {{variable}} placeholders
- Excel templates use exceljs to fill cell values while preserving formatting
